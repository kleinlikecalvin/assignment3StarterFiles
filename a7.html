                            It's understandable wanting to share a snack with your catâ€”but before you do, it's important to know what foods are
                            toxic for cats, since many popular human foods are poisonous to our feline friends.

                            People love pets. They're cute, cuddly and fun! But having a pet involves much more than just love. There's a huge
                            commitment involved; pets need food and water, medical care and lots of attention. Unfortunately, with all of these
                            responsibilities, many people find that they are in over their heads.
