			<h1>The Adoption of Joonipurr Pip Kleinenheimer</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Good day fair website veiwer! My name is Nikki, I've been studying frontend web development since the
				beginning of 2020. This fall semester I began studying at my local college and I'm excited to be
				practicing my skills andd working towards a future in programming. At this moment, I am developing a
				youth service nonprofit called
				<a href="https://www.anaheimyoutopia.com/" target="_blank">Anaheim Youtopia</a> and it's been quite the
				learning experience as well as a great way to remain in alignment with my passion to support the youth
				of my
				city. I'm also a proud cat mom! I adopted Joonior in October of 2020 when she was just 6 weeks old!
			</p>
			<p>This site isn't about me though, it's about Joon. Joon asked me to develop this site so she can share all
				the great times and adventures she's been having since her adoption. In the first six weeks of her life
				she was born, obviously, then removed from the care of her mother because she couldn't provide a healthy
				upbringing. Some giant scooped her and her siblings up, put them in a car, and drove them to a big
				facility where there are all sorts of other animals. Once there, Joon was examined then placed in a cage
				with her siblings. The cage was in a room with a lot of other cats. People would come and see her but
				never took her. When I met her, she was scared and not interested in giants. She wanted to be back in
				the cage with her brother where she felt safe. I gave her some time to adjust and started to notice
				little blips of her bold personality shine through. The moment I knew this was my new baby was when I
				scritchy scratched her little baby butt and she loved it. I knew then that she had a great personality
				and we'd get along just fine once she was in a healthy trusting environment. Before she could come home
				with me, she had to get a hysterectomy. I'm sure this was a traumatic experience for her, but it was
				comforting to me. I used to be the only youngin' I knew who had a hysterctomy, but I was no longer alone
				and neither was she.</p>
