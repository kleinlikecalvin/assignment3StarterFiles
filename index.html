			<h1>The Adoption of Joonipurr Pip Kleinenheimer</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Good day fair website veiwer! My name is Nikki, I've been studying frontend web development since the
				beginning of 2020. This fall semester I began studying at my local college and I'm excited to be
				practicing my skills andd working towards a future in programming. At this moment, I am developing a
				youth service nonprofit called
				<a href="https://www.anaheimyoutopia.com/" target="_blank">Anaheim Youtopia</a> and it's been a great
				learning experience and a great way to remain in alignment with my passion to support the youth of my
				city. I am also a proud cat mom, I adopted Joonior in October of 2020 when she was just 6 weeks old!
